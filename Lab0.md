* Class Diagram:
Class diagrams are designed using a syntax that mirrors those traditionally employed in programming languages. This resemblance fosters a familiar environment for developers, thereby facilitating an easier and more intuitive diagram creation process.
This design approach is not only succinct but also enables the creation of representations that are both concise and expressive. Moreover, it allows for the portrayal of relationships between classes through a syntax that echoes that of sequence diagrams, paving the way for a fluid and insightful depiction of class interactions.

* Use Case Diagram
A use case diagram is a visual representation used in software engineering to depict the interactions between system actors and the system itself. It captures the dynamic behavior of a system by illustrating its use cases and the roles that interact with them. These diagrams are essential in specifying the system's functional requirements and understanding how users will interact with the system. By providing a high-level view, use case diagrams help stakeholders understand the system's functionality and its potential value.

GraphViz: Needed only for some diagrams.
Linux: You'll find mode information here about GraphViz installation
Windows: A compiled version of GraphViz is embedded within PlantUML, eliminating the need for a separate installation. However, if needed, you can acquire a standalone version
